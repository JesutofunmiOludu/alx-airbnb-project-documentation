### 🧠 Notes
- Each user story maps directly to a **use case** from the system diagram.  
- The stories cover both **functional** (e.g., booking, payments) and **non-functional** aspects (e.g., security, notifications).  
- These stories form the foundation for **backend API design** and **database relationships**.
